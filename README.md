The app folder contains the production versions of all the files.
The dist folder contains the compiled and optimized versions. Files should not be placed into this folder except by the Gulp build process.
The Other Files folder contains mostly old and unneeded files.

To run gulp, first install all dependencies through npm (npm install), then run the gulp commands to automatically create builds. Use the command 'gulp' to run the default build without automatic updating. Run 'gulp watch' to run Gulp with watched files and automatic browser refresh.
