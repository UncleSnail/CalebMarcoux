Real projects:
Link website - What I learned: There are often systems already in place that one must work with. Simply because these systems may not be the most efficient does not mean they can be thrown out. We must learn to work with what is already built, and improve upon it.
Database - What I learned: sometimes projects are harder than expected, and it can be difficult to put in the last steps to completion, and conform to client needs.
