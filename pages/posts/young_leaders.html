              Young employees may be seen as inferior and inexperienced. They have often been in a company for much less time than older, more seasoned employees. This can lead to newer employees being looked down upon as unfit to hold leadership positions and make decisions. However, new employees can take up the responsibility of leadership without actually holding a leadership position. This article will be a response to

              Many young employees lack experience and focus. These are two reasons leadership roles are often given to other members of a company. There are benefits to be gained from these traits, even if they are not immediately apparent. Less experience means a worker may be more willing to think of new, more innovative solutions that older workers may not have pondered. This is especially useful in a leadership role, as it allows them to remain more open to everyone’s ideas, and not dismiss something as too insane because it is farther from convention. Our society is moving towards fast paced multitasking, and many younger employees are naturally able to handle many incoming stimuli. This may inhibit focused activity on a single process, but it facilitates quick evaluation of the situation, and it allows younger leaders to consider all potential options with much more efficiency. Leaders must also multi-task, and our modern environment, even unimportant actions like web browsing or video games, encourage  keeping focused on multiple situations simultaneously. These skills prepare young people to be optimal leaders.

              Although the skills naturally present may allow young people to perform well as leaders, they should not attempt to assert themselves as leaders. Leadership is not taking control of a project and managing other employees. These may be the tasks of a leadership position, but new employees should rather seek to have leadership attitudes. That means helping those around us, giving our input, and carefully considering the input of others. A true leaders is one who serves others, taking more interest in the success of others than in personal happiness or comfort. This is why students should be learning these leadership behaviors before they even enter the workforce. Leadership positions in school and church help an individual fell comfortable with leading others, and develop an idea of what is required in a leadership position. Leading the skills of treating people appropriately and with respect will allow students to gain important insights into effective strengths of a strong leader. Not only will you learn , but you will gain experience, giving you more confidence leading, and making others more comfortable with you leading. Serving the community can set a correct mindset, and always watching what other leaders are doing to become effective can lead directly to a successful career as a leader where everyone is grateful for your participation.

              Leaders need not be old. They must simply be willing to learn continually, take initiative, and respect others. A younger individual’s ability to think quickly about a variety of tasks, and consider many opinions with a fresh mind may be an asset to an employer. Employees do not need to wait before they become leaders. Leadership starts now with an attitude of service that will help everyone and accomplish tasks. A good leader can be of any age, so start acting with a heart of leadership in the present, to make the world better for others tomorrow.
