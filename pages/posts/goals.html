              Writing goals can often be the first important step to accomplishing great things. Here are three of my SMART goals for this year.
            </h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Increase my Pre Calculus grade to an A.
                <ul>
                  <li>Why: I have worked hard to keep my grades high in school. Since I have been in high school, I have not gotten lower than an A in any classes. However, this semester I recieved a B+ in Pre Calculus. I would like to increase that grade to an A this semester.</li>
                  <li>When: I will achieve this goal during this semester.</li>
                  <li>How: I will study more and spend more time to do better in the class.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Finish my scholarship essay.
                <ul>
                  <li>Why: I am on my way to being able to afford college, but I still do not have all of it covered. I would like to write an essay worthy of a sholarship, that I can be proud of, within the deadline.</li>
                  <li>When: I will know I have completed my goal if I have my full essay complete by January 26th.</li>
                  <li>How: I will write the first rough draft on Wednesday (tomorrow) and look over it with my English professor on Thursday, getting his advise. I will then submit it to my high school teahers and aunt for review. Revisions will be made before looking over it with my English professor again on Tuesday.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Fix my bluetooth speaker.
                <ul>
                  <li>Why: I love electronics and love solving problems/fixing things. The charging port on my bluetooth speaker broke, and I took apart the speaker, removing the old USB charging port. I intend to replace it and regain a working speaker.</li>
                  <li>When: I will attempt to fix the speaker by February 5. If I can not get it working that is okay. I must attempt to solder on a new port by February 5 for this goal to be a success.</li>
                  <li>How: I will order the new USB charging port tomorrow, and attempt soldering it two weeks from now. This allows time for the new parts to arrive. If I can not get it fixed, I will need a new plan, but I will think about that once I have tried.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              These goals will help me to achieve my goals of going to college, enjoying time completing personal projects, and furthering my knowledge of electronics. I look forward to getting started.
