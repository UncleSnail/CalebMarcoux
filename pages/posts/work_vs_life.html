              It is impossible to do everything. For someone like me, however, doing anything less is often unacceptable. I love so many things and have so many goals that I must narrow down my priorities and interests to the most important things, doing those first, then move towards less important ones. On top of that, strategy can be used to save time and accomplish multiple goals simultaneously. A career is one of the best areas to blend all of my passions and achieve my goals while earning a living.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, I must enter a field I love. A majority of my life will be spent at work, and if I don’t love what I’m doing, a majority of my life will be spent doing something I don’t care about. Programming has been one of my joys most of my life, and it is something I would love to have the time to do well into my future. What better way to ensure I have time for something than to make it a necessity? I can then pour my life into something I love, truly investing myself in each project, and striving to produce something for which I can be proud.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second to working in a field I love is finding an employer with similar values. I consider helping my community and impacting others crucial parts of my life. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find the time to accomplish these goals. If I work for a company that feels the same way as I do, they will also make it a priority, and I can fully get on board with any projects that further our mission. I enjoy learning and growing as much as I can to give everything my best effort, and when I am with others who apply this same zeal, we can accomplish great things. When our goals as a company is to help others, it’s my company. I’m not working for someone else’s vision, I’m working for my vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly, it is important that I keep in mind my priorities. I do not aim to be rich, except for the purpose of giving to others. It is imperative that I find a business that recognizes making money is not the final goal. I only want to make money so I can further my mission: to provide for those around me, including my family. That is why any employer must understand, my family is first. Often the most important provision for children is time, not money. If I have the freedom to go or stay if necessary, I can be fully focused when I am working. This understanding allows me to pour in extra time to go above and beyond, yet realize when something else is more important and take a break.
            </p>
            <p>
              When working in a field I love, for a company that shares my mission, and with a schedule that respects my values, any employer can be assured I will be an asset. My edge is my passion, and if your mission can be my mission, together we will push beyond the bounds of what has been achieved in the past. I will accomplish my goals, and that is why it is so imperative I find an appropriate occupation. I am finite, and I want to be able to give all of me to the things I love: people, values, faith, causes, projects. The things that matter in life deserve more than a sliver of what’s left of me . . . they deserve all of me.
