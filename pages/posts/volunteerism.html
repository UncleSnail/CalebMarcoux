              As time goes on, volunteering becomes more and more difficult. This is because my schedule is continually filling more and more as my classes become more difficult. However, there are still things I can do to help. I try to help with Foodnet once every month. This is a time when we can sort the old food from grocery stores, and help distribute it to the needy here in Lincoln. I also control the power point slides at my church every week. These are simple and enjoyable ways to give something back to the community.

              I have started a volunteering project, making a database for a nonprofit organization here in Lincoln, ShelterMeNe. This project has helped me to experience some of the problems on a real development cycle. I am not finished yet, and am struggling to find the time and motivation to complete this project. However, I still intend to finish it, and have been working on the next steps. This is my major ongoing volunteer project.

              Aside from ‘typical’ volunteer work, I believe one of the most important types of community service is our everyday human interactions. One of the best ways to be a true servant of the community is to be a good citizen. This means helping those around me when I see there is something to be done. This means talking to the people I see, saying good morning, and opening doors for those behind me. When I see trash on the floor, I try to pick it up. Is someone’s car broken down? Stop and ask if they need help? Our world would be so much better if we started seeing this city as our responsibility. It is not someone else’s job to pick up that soda can. It is not someone else’s job to show love to those around us. In the end, it is not a few large acts of community service that will make the difference, but hundreds of small things done by thousands of thoughtful individuals that will change the world.
