//Style and layout informations block -

// _layout contains classes related to positiioning elements.
// _base contains the base element selectors and styles.

//Some classes are dependant on which other companion classes are present.
//For example, the classes right and left should be used with another class.
//If a div is in both the right and the wave classes, it will form a wave
//with the highest point on the right of the screen.
