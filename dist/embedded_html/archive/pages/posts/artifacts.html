            <h3>Discovering one's strengths is not all that helpful until they are put to use. Knowing a talent exists and not at least considering how it has played a role in my life would negate the purpose of discovering the skill. Thus we must search for areas where our skills have been used. We must find artifacts. Then, we must go out and plant more artifacts, little treasures for those around us to enjoy. Here are some of my artifacts based on my Gallup strengths.</h3>
