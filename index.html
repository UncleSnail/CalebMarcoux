                After moving to Nebraska to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on my education, I heard about The Career Academy.<br>
                As a home-school student I overcame many hurdles to sign up, but I persevered them and am doing exceptionally with an unweighted college <span class="highlight">GPA of 4.0.</span><br>
                Since I was eight I have <span class="highlight">loved programming,</span> and am eager to get started on some more long term projects. I am enthusiastic and bring my <span class="highlight">positive attitude</span> and quality work ethic to any job in which I participate.
